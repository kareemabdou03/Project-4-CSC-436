This project is a small backend built with Node.js and Express that works like a REST API for managing tasks. Instead of using a real database, the tasks are saved in a simple array in memory. You can add tasks, view them, update them, and delete them using different API routes.

It’s mainly for learning how servers work things like handling requests, sending JSON responses, working with different HTTP methods, and testing everything in Postman.
